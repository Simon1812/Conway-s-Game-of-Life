This is my implementation of Conway's Game of Life link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life.

To execute the code, the play.py file must be started. If you want to configure the application, change the corresponding values in the config.yaml file.

To run the unit tests, simply execute the test.py file.

The required packages are defined in the requirements.txt file.
